	\begin{enumerate}
		\item An Academic Review shall be held whenever the Scholarship Chair requests a suspension trial in accordance with the duties of their office. 
		\item An Academic Review must be scheduled prior to the associated suspension trial.
		%Since the scholarship bylaws instruct the scholarship chair to request suspension trials for retreat, the academic review needs to be the day before. This don’t seem to be the sort of thing to actually put into the bylaws.
		\item An Academic Review is not a Standards Board Trial.
		% Just to be clear, there is no accuser, there is no accused, there are no charges, there is no plea, and there are no sanctions.
		\item An Academic Review shall be carried out by the Arbiter, Parliamentarian, Scribe, Scholarship Chair, and Standards Board Justices. 
		\item A quorum of Standards Board is required to hold an Academic Review.
		\item Attendance of an Academic Review is mandatory for all members of the board, and the Scholarship Chair.
		\item A justice may be recused from an Academic Review under the following circumstances:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Members of the board for whom the Scholarship Chair is requesting a suspension trial will recuse themselves.
				% As it stands this cannot actually happen, as to be brought up by the scholarship chair you have to be below the officer threshold, and as such are automatically removed from your position. This is here just in case it doesnt work like that, and regardless this should still be a thing.
				\item Members of the board will recuse themselves if they feel a conflict of interests exists.
				\item Members of the board may be recused by simple majority vote of the remaining board. The brother under review, the Scholarship Chair, or a member of the board may call for such a vote.

					% Again not sure if this can happen but alas

				\end{enumerate}
				\item  Preparation:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item The brother under review is not required to attend.
					% It’s not reasonable to try to force people to show up the day before retreat on what might be fairly short notice. (Specifically regarding Spring semester)
					\item Both the brother under review and the Scholarship Chair may provide witnesses and any form of relevant documents, including written statements. If either the brother under review or the Scholarship Chair cannot attend the review, any such documents must be sent to the scribe along with an order of any witnesses to be called.
					\item The Arbiter will call the meeting to order and ask all but unrecused members of the board, the Scholarship Chair, and the brother under review to leave the room.

					\item The Scholarship Chair may then be asked questions by the brother under review and the board.
					\item The brother under review may then be asked questions by the Scholarship Chair and the board.
					\item The Scholarship Chair and then the brother under review may then present any witnesses or documents. If they are not present, the provided witnesses and documents will be presented in the provided order. After each witnesses gives a statement the Scholarship Chair, brother under review, and board may ask questions of the witness. Documents will remain with the scribe until the conclusion of the review.
					\item The Scholarship Chair and brother under review may give closing statements, in that order.
					\item The Arbiter will excuse the Scholarship Chair and brother under review.
					\item The board will then deliberate. The board may consult any documents and recall any witnesses, the Scholarship Chair, or the brother under review if further questions arise.
					\item The board will vote to recommend the brother under review for suspension, or to not recommend the brother under review for suspension.
					\item The Arbiter will recall the Scholarship Chair and the brother under review and inform them of the boards decision.
					\item If the board voted not to recommend the brother under review for suspension, the Arbiter will instruct the Scholarship Chair to withdraw their request for a suspension trial for the brother under review immediately.
				\end{enumerate}
			\end{enumerate}
		\item If an academic review cannot be held for a brother before the requested suspension trial, the Arbiter will inform the chapter during that trial that no review was held and that no recommendation has been given.
		\item In the event that the board does not recommend the brother under review for suspension the proceedings of the review will be confidential.
		\item In the event that the board recommends the brother under review for suspension the proceedings of the review will not be confidential. Any statements by the Scholarship Chair, brother under review, or witnesses, the content of any presented documents, and the nature of the boards deliberation may be requested and discussed during the associated suspension trial.
